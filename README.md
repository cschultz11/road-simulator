# Road Simulator
A very basic road simulation that was designed in order to better understand implementing JSON imports and exports in C++, as well as to familiarize myself with object-oriented design. This program reads in a JSON file, which provides coordinates and road names to the program. At this point, the JSON.cpp file parses this data using logic, designing a whole map for the roadways. From there, several classes are used, ranging from cars and trucks, which have their own respective acceleration and deceleration, traffic lights, roads, and stop signs. As an introductory project to JSON parsing and a more in-depth lesson on polymorphism and object-oriented programming, the overall submission successfully demonstrates the necessary requirements of the assignment.
